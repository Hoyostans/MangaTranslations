<!-- Page 1 --> On this planet, the Honkai grows with civilisation.
The more human civilisation develops, the stronger the Honkai's restraints on it become.
<!-- Page 2 --> Over fifty-two thousand years ago, a previous generation of humans on Earth had developed a high level civilisation.
In order to inhibit the continued development of this civilisation, beings with a human form, yet supernatural in kind, were born from the Honkai: "The Herrscher"
The Sixth Herrscher accelerated the apoptosis of living cells:<br> "The Herrscher of Death"
The Seventh Herrscher controlled the motions of molecules:<br> "The Herrscher of Flame"
The Fourth Herrscher could create perfect fluids:<br> "The Herrscher of Wind"
The Third Herrscher could control the electromagnetic field:<br> "The Herrscher of Thunder'
<!-- Page 3 --> The Herrschers' abilities were extremely powerful.
But with the support of a power called "technology", humans have defeated Herrschers time and again.
<!-- Page 4 --> In order to battle the Herrschers, which were becoming more and more evolved, humanity began to study their secrets.
By sealing the remnants of the "Fragmented Herrscher Cores"
in Soulium made from nano machines, humans created "weapons".
<!-- Page 5 --> But humanity was not satisfied with this. Under the leadership of MEI, a top scientist of that civilisation, mankind strode deeper into the field.
To seek the origin of the Honkai was taboo research, and the material used for that research was the Herrscher Cores.
<!-- Page 6 --> Although humanity could not completely analyse the Herrscher Cores, they eventually managed to use the results of their research to create the keys that could unlock the door to "Sanctuary". Those were the thirteen "Divine Keys", which exhausted the Earth's resources and carried the last hopes of mankind.
Including a device which restrains Herrschers and Honkai Beasts with the ultimate power of "Binding":<br> "Oath of Judah"
Reversing the power of the Herrscher of Death, this lance holds the ultimate power of "Creation":<br> "Black Abyss, White Flower"
Recreating the power of the Herrscher of Flame, the dual pistols harness the ultimate power of "Destruction":<br> "Judgement of Shamash"
<!-- Page 7 --> And... the golden sword with the ultimate power of "Domination":<br> "Xuanyuan Sword"
The Xuanyuan sword contains the power of six Herrschers, including Thunder, Flame and Ice. As long as certain conditions are met, it may absorb and fuse the powers of other Herrschers.
Relying on these thirteen weapons, humanity gradually acquired an advantage in the war against the Honkai-
<!-- Page 8 --> However, facing the "Last Herrscher", humanity's hope was crushed.
<!-- Page 9 --> The downfall of mankind was inevitable, but MEI refused to give up.
*clench*
She knew that when the next civilisation of Earth would be born, the Honkai would surely occur once more. Thus... she planted the "Seeds of Revenge"
She transcribed her life long research into human genes.
When these recessive genetic factors would express in the next generation of humans, they would display "stigmata".
Young girls with these genetic factors were shielded in safe pods, waiting to be awoken tens of thousands of years into the future.
<!-- Page 10 --> The twin girls responsible for guarding Xuanyuan Sword were called Fuxi and Nuwa.
<!-- Page 11 --> Fifty thousand years later, civilisation had been reborn in this land called "Shenzhou", and the Honkai... also awakened.
The twin girls woke up from their deep sleep and after a long journey, they finally found a warrior fit to inherit the Xuanyuan Sword.
The moment the girl named Ji Xuanyuan picked up the Xuanyuan Sword, the stigmata imprinted in her bloodline awakened.
<!-- Page 12 --> And so, between humanity's hatred for the Honkai and Honkai's hatred for humanity, the war of fate had begun once more.
This time, the war would last thousands of years.
<!-- Page 13 --> Honkai -News- <br> Schicksal Archive Department Database Update Notice
According to the recent investigation results of the Schicksal Archeological Department on the ancient relic A-62, a number of names of characters from the Previous Era civilisation have been confirmed through research and comparison. Therefore, AI-chan will replace the names of the respective characters:
Li Er → Xiao Yun <br> Fuxi → Cang Xuan <br> Nuwa → Dan Zhu <br> Shennong → Lianshan <br> Jingwei → Chiyuan <br> Ji Xuanyuan → Ji Lin
Due to reasons we have yet to confirm, several characters had their names changed for the official Chinese version of the story. However, the English version retained the original versions of their names.

<!-- Page 1 --> On this planet, the Honkai grows with civilisation.
The more human civilisation develops, the stronger the Honkai's restraints on it become.
<!-- Page 2 --> Every time a Herrscher is defeated, humans pay a heavy price.
After defeating the Eleventh Herrscher, "Herrscher of Binding," nearly 70% of civilization on Earth was destroyed.
<!-- Page 3 --> However, the Honkai's threat was far from gone
according to the calculations of Dr MEI, the world's most advanced scientist, and Prometheus, the super AI she designed.
<!-- Page 4 --> There would be fourteen Herrschers in total, and the power of the Fourteenth Herrscher would far exceed that of the Herrschers prior.
Before the 'last of the Herrschers', mankind's only fate would be destruction.
<!-- Page 5 --> Humanity's only remaining hope was to fight the Herrscher using the power of Herrschers.
From MEI's research a weapon made from a Herrscher Core, the 'Divine Key', was born.
<!-- Page 6 --> From the core of the Sixth Herrscher: <small><small>Black</small></small> Abyss <small><small>White</small></small> Flower
From the core of the Seventh Herrscher: Judgement of Shamash
From the core of the Tenth Herrscher: Xuanyuan Sword
And...f rom the core of the Eleventh Herrscher: Oath of Judah
<!-- Page 7 --> Around this time, the Twelfth Herrscher appeared.
Unlike other Herrschers, although a violent Honkai energy reaction was detected in the girl's body, she did not have any special powers.
Moreover, she still retained her human consciousness.
<!-- Page 8 --> Despite appearing to be a weak girl, she was taken away and imprisoned on the 33rd floor of 'the Base' out of fear of the Herrschers.
Dr MEI was responsible for studying the girl's mysteries.
<!-- Page 9 --> The girl kept begging to be let go so she could return to her sister.
MEI was also puzzled, but she could not let the Herrscher go until the truth had been uncovered.
The girl, still retaining a human mind, remained in the dark cell, lonely and afraid.
But the nightmare had only just begun...
<!-- Page 9 --> Although Dr MEI had ordered that the girl must not be harmed, fear towards her grew stronger day by day.
Despite being an ordinary girl, nobody could guarantee that that was her true nature. Such an idea continued to grow in people's minds-
Until one day, an insubordinate broke into the cell and brutally killed the unarmed "girl".
The last thing the girl saw was people cheering around her body. "We killed another Herrscher!"
<!-- Page 10 --> However, nobody had anticipated the power of the Twelfth Herrscher: The Herrscher of Corruption.
<b>It came out the moment the girl died.</b>
