<!-- Page 1 --> On this planet, the Honkai grows with civilisation.
The more human civilisation develops, the stronger the Honkai's restraints on it become.
<!-- Page 2 --> Over 52.000 years ago, a previous generation of humans on Earth had developed a high level civilisation.
In order to inhibit the continued development of this civilisation, beings with a human form, yet supernatural in kind, were born from the Honkai: "The Herrscher"
The Sixth Herrscher accelerated the apoptosis of living cells:<br> "The Herrscher of Death"
The Seventh Herrscher controlled the motions of molecules:<br> "The Herrscher of Flame"
The Fourth Herrscher could create perfect fluids:<br> "The Herrscher of Wind"
The Third Herrscher could control the electromagnetic field:<br> "The Herrscher of Thunder'
<!-- Page 3 --> The Herrschers' abilities are extremely powerful.
But with the support of a power called "technology", humans have defeated Herrschers time and again.
<!-- Page 4 --> In order to battle the Herrschers, which were becoming more and more evolved, humanity began to study their secrets.
By sealing the remnants of the "Fragmented Herrscher Cores"
in Soulium made from nano machines, humans created "weapons".
<!-- Page 5 --> But humanity was not satisfied with this. Under the leadership of MEI, a top scientist of that civilisation, mankind strode deeper into the field.
To seek the origin of the Honkai was taboo research, and the material used for that research was the Herrscher Cores.
<!-- Page 6 --> Although humanity could not completely analyse the Herrscher Cores, they eventually managed to use the results of their research to create a key that could unlock the door to "Sanctuary"
Those were the thirteen "Divine Keys", which exhausted the Earth's resources and carried the last hopes of mankind.
Including a device which restrains Herrschers and Honkai Beasts with the ultimate power of "Binding":<br> "Oath of Judah"
Reversing the power of the Herrscher of Death, this lance holds the ultimate power of "Creation":<br> "Black Abyss, White Flower"
Recreating the power of the Herrscher of Flame, the dual pistols harness the ultimate power of "Destruction":<br> "Judgement of Shamash"
<!-- Page 7 --> And... the golden sword with the ultimate power of "Domination":<br> "Xuanyuan Sword"
The Xuanyuan sword contains the power of six Herrschers, including Thunder, Flame and Ice. As long as certain conditions are met, it may absorb and fuse the powers of other Herrschers.
Relying on these thirteen weapons, humanity gradually acquired an advantage in the war against the Honkai-
<!-- Page 8 --> However, facing the "Last Herrscher", humanity's hope was crushed.
