<!-- Page 1 --> On this planet, the Honkai grows with civilisation.
The more human civilisation develops, the stronger the Honkai's restraints on it become.
<!-- Page 2 --> Over 52.000 years ago, a previous generation of humans on Earth had developed a high level civilisation.
In order to inhibit the continued development of this civilisation, beings with a human form, yet supernatural in kind, were born from the Honkai: "Herrschers"
The Sixth Herrscher accelerated the apoptosis of living cells:<br> "The Herrscher of Death"
The Seventh Herrscher controlled the motions of molecules:<br> "The Herrscher of Flame"
The Fourth Herrscher could create perfect fluids:<br> "The Herrscher of Wind"
The Third Herrscher controlled electromagnetic fields:<br> "The Herrscher of Thunder'
<!-- Page 3 --> The Herrschers' abilities were extremely powerful.
But with the support of a power called "technology", humans defeated Herrschers time and again.
<!-- Page 4 --> In order to battle the Herrschers, which were becoming increasingly evolved, humanity began to study their secrets.
By sealing the remnants of the "Fragmented Herrscher Cores"
in Soulium made from nano machines, the humans created "weapons".
<!-- Page 5 --> But humanity was not satisfied with this. Under the leadership of MEI, a top scientist of that civilisation, mankind strode deeper into the field.
To seek the origin of the Honkai was taboo research, and the material used for that research was the Herrscher Cores.
<!-- Page 6 --> Although humanity could not completely analyse the Herrscher Cores, they eventually managed to use the results of their research to create the keys that could unlock the door to "Sanctuary". Those were the thirteen "Divine Keys", which exhausted the Earth's resources and carried the last hopes of mankind.
Including a device which restrains Herrschers and Honkai Beasts with the ultimate power of "Binding":<br> "Oath of Judah"
Reversing the power of the Herrscher of Death, this lance holds the ultimate power of "Creation":<br> "Black Abyss, White Flower"
Recreating the power of the Herrscher of Flame, the dual pistols harness the ultimate power of "Destruction":<br> "Judgement of Shamash"
<!-- Page 7 --> And... the golden sword with the ultimate power of "Domination":<br> "Xuanyuan Sword"
The Xuanyuan sword contains the power of six Herrschers, including Thunder, Flame and Ice. As long as certain conditions are met, it may absorb and fuse the powers of other Herrschers.
Relying on these thirteen weapons, humanity gradually acquired an advantage in the war against the Honkai-
<!-- Page 8 --> However, facing the "Last Herrscher", humanity's hope was crushed.
<!-- Page 9 --> The downfall of mankind was inevitable, yet MEI refused to give up.
*clench*
She knew that when the next civilisation of Earth would be born, the Honkai would surely occur once more. Thus... she planted the "Seeds of Revenge"
She transcribed her life long research into the human genome.
When these recessive genetic factors would come to expression in the next generation of humans, they would display "stigmata".
Young girls with these genetic factors were shielded in safe pods, waiting to be awoken tens of thousands of years into the future.
<!-- Page 10 --> The twin girls responsible for guarding Xuanyuan Sword were called Fuxi and Nuwa.
<!-- Page 11 --> 50.000 years later, civilisation had been reborn in this land called "Shenzhou", and the Honkai... also awakened.
The twin girls woke up from their deep sleep and after a long journey, they finally found a warrior fit to inherit the Xuanyuan Sword.
The moment the girl named Ji Xuanyuan picked up the Xuanyuan Sword, the stigmata imprinted in her bloodline awakened.
<!-- Page 12 --> And so, between humanity's hatred for the Honkai and Honkai's hatred for humanity, the war of fate had begun once more.
This time, the war would last thousands of years.
<!-- Page 13 --> Honkai -News- <br> Schicksal Archive Department Database Update Notice
According to the recent investigation results of the Schicksal Archeological Department on the ancient relic A-62, a number of names of characters from the Previous Era civilisation have been confirmed through research and comparison. Therefore, AI-chan will replace the names of the respective characters:
Li Er → Xiao Yun <br> Fuxi → Cang Xuan <br> Nuwa → Dan Zhu <br> Shennong → Lianshan <br> Jingwei → Chiyuan <br> Ji Xuanyuan → Ji Lin
Due to reasons we have yet to confirm, several characters had their names changed for the official Chinese version of the story. However, the English version retained the original versions of their names.

<!-- Page 1 --> On this planet, the Honkai grows with civilisation.
The more human civilisation develops, the stronger the Honkai's restraints on it become.
<!-- Page 2 --> Every time a Herrscher is defeated, humanity pays a heavy price.
After defeating the Eleventh Herrscher, "Herrscher of Binding," nearly 70% of civilization on Earth was destroyed.
<!-- Page 3 --> However, the Honkai's threat was far from gone
according to the calculations of Dr MEI, the world's most advanced scientist, and Prometheus, the super AI she designed.
<!-- Page 4 --> There would be fourteen Herrschers in total, and the power of the Fourteenth Herrscher would far exceed that of the Herrschers prior.
Facing the 'Final Herrscher', mankind's only fate would be destruction.
<!-- Page 5 --> Humanity's only remaining hope was to fight the Herrscher using the power of Herrschers.
From MEI's research the 'Divine Key', a weapon made from a Herrscher Core, was born.
<!-- Page 6 --> From the core of the Sixth Herrscher: <small><small>Black</small></small> Abyss <small><small>White</small></small> Flower
From the core of the Seventh Herrscher: Judgement of Shamash
From the core of the Tenth Herrscher: Xuanyuan Sword
And...from the core of the Eleventh Herrscher: Oath of Judah
<!-- Page 7 --> Around this time, the Twelfth Herrscher appeared.
Unlike other Herrschers, although a violent Honkai energy reaction was detected in the girl's body, she did not have any special powers.
Moreover, she still retained her human consciousness.
<!-- Page 8 --> Despite appearing to be a weak girl, she was taken away and imprisoned on the 33rd floor of 'the Base' out of fear of the Herrschers.
Dr MEI was responsible for studying the girl's mysteries.
<!-- Page 9 --> The girl kept begging to be let go so she could return to her sister.
MEI was also puzzled, but she could not let the Herrscher go until the truth had been uncovered.
The girl, still retaining a human mind, remained in the dark cell, lonely and afraid.
But the nightmare had only just begun...
<!-- Page 10 --> Although Dr MEI had ordered that the girl must not be harmed, fear towards her grew stronger day by day.
Despite being an ordinary girl, nobody could guarantee that that was her true nature. Such an idea continued to grow in people's minds-
Until one day, an insubordinate broke into the cell and brutally killed the unarmed "girl".
The last thing the girl saw was people cheering around her body. "We killed another Herrscher!"
<!-- Page 11 --> However, nobody had anticipated the power of the Twelfth Herrscher: The Herrscher of Corruption.
<b>would appear the moment the girl died.</b>
<!-- Page 12 --> The girl's body slowly decomposed into a black mist laden with potent Honkai Energy.
People near the holding cells were infected by the black mist and became zombies. They soon attacked other people in the base, but they were not a threat.
About 15 minutes after the chaos broke out, the last zombie was eliminated in the F-23 monitoring room at the base.
However, this is where it all started-
<!-- Page 13 --> - one minute later, all computer systems in the base had been invaded by some unknown virus.
This was the true form of the Twelfth Herrscher: An ultimate virus with self-awareness.
Not only could she corrupt humans, but she could also control beasts and machines. Now this virus, along with the girl's hatred towards humanity, had taken complete control of the base's defense systems.
Then, her revenge began--
<!-- Page 14 --> There was a large number of nuclear bombs stored at the base. These were originally meant to be the last resort weapon to use against Herrschers. Now, all nuclear weapons had been launched at the last three remaining cities.
The three cities were obliterated in an instant, as people and buildings were instantly vaporised by the high temperature of the nuclear explosions.
Now, only the 31,022 people left at the base remained.
<!-- Page 15 --> At this time, controlled by the Twelfth Herrscher, the base locked down all exits to the world outside.
If these loathsome humans were so unwilling to let the innocent girl go, then they should die with her in this tomb!
However, Dr MEI would not give up without a fight.
Dr MEI set a trap to make the Twelfth Herrscher store its core consciousness in the base's main control system. Then, Dr MEI disconnected the system and sealed it in a black box.
<!-- Page 16 --> Dr MEI wanted to make the Twelfth Herrscher into a Divine Key as well.
But the Twelfth Herrscher's consciousness was still resisting.
-The Twelfth Divine Key was not forged before the 'Final Herrscher' destroyed humanity completely.
<!-- Page 17 --> The Herrscher spent tens of thousands of years in darkness in the small black box.
In the end, she could no longer even sense the passage of time, and only pure hatred remained in her heart.
<!-- Page 18 --> After tens of thousands of years. About 500 years ago,
the box fell into the hands of Schicksal.
Although the power of the Twelfth Herrscher had gradually weakened over time, the Honkai Energy she emitted still attracted some malintentioned people.
In order to stop Schicksal's horrendous experiments, Schicksal Valkyrie Kallen stole the box and fled to an island nation in the Far East.
Later, as a result of circumstance, the box was opened by a shrine maiden named Yae Sakura. At that moment, the Twelfth Herrscher of the Previous Era was freed from captivity.
<!-- Page 19 --> Yae Sakura was overtaken by the Herrscher's hatred, and became a tool for revenge against humanity.
But there was still a glimmer of hope in her heart.
Finally, after 500 years, with the help of some brave Valkyries--
Yae Sakura defeated the Herrscher's consciousness and regained her self.
<!-- Page 20 --> On the other side, at the moment the Twelfth herrscher's consciousness gave up on resisting,
the black box initiated the execution of the instructions left by Dr MEI before her passing.
50.000 years late, the Twelfth Divine Key was finalised.
This story is the tragedy of a young girl.
It is also the tragedy of the whole world.
<!-- Page 21 --> But we still can't tell which was the victim.
<!--Third Chapter--><!-- Page 0 --><b>Judgement of Shamash</b> <br> Main Author: Ego_TDC24 <br> Assistants: Kumako, ika, 花耶<br>--<br>Translation: Mister Spaceman <br> Revision: Hoyostans Open Group
<!-- Page 1 --> The "Judgement of Shamash" was forged with the core of the Herrscher of Flame. <br> Even among the Divine Keys, it has an unrivaled destructive power.
In order to inhibit its power, the core of the Herrscher of Flame is normally divided into two pieces and placed within the twin pistols.
When the twin pistols are combined into the form of a greatsword, the fragments will recombine into the Herrscher Core, unleashing its true power.
Faced with the blazing storm of fire the greatsword creates, not even an Emperor class Honkai Beast would escape its destructive fate.
<!-- Page 2 --> However, the user at the centre of the flames too would not escape the fate of being consumed by them.
<!-- Page 3 --> The "Judgement of Shamash" was born in the Previous Era of civilisation.
This story begins when the Third Herrscher had not yet been born, and most people in the world were still living with a false sense of peace.
In the City of Nagazora in the Far East, there was a school called Chiba Academy.
<!-- Page 4 --> Kevin, who was from a European nation, transferred to this school three months earlier.
Handsome and good-looking, with his outstanding athletic ability, he soon became a 'prince' in the eyes of the girls at school.
Kevin had countless suitors, but the prince had no interest in them.
<!-- Page 5 --> Because just three months before, on the day he transferred to this school...
he found the love of his life.
- Mei was called a nerd by her classmates.
Mei's father was a world-renowned physicist in the field of electromagnetism.
And she too aspired to become a scientist. Therefore, she only ever focused on studying, and had no interest in anything else.
<!-- Page 6 --> This naturally also applied to matters of 'romance'.
<!-- Page 7 --> No matter what means prince Kevin used to get her attention,
she was able to ignore him completely.
<!-- Page 8 --> As Mei tried to avoid Kevin, Kevin tried to get into Mei's heart in turn.
But his behaviour was...
sometimes childish.
<!-- Page 9 --> If these peaceful days had continued...
The prince and the nerdy girl might have headed towards a happy ending.
Unfortunately, this peace was broken on this fateful day...
<!-- Page 10 --> The Third Honkai Eruption broke out in the City of Nagazora.
Under the sounding sirens, people rushed to the shelters in panic.
<!-- Page 11 --> Kevin protected Mei in the crowds, as they tried to escape from this hell.
That's when they met a man in a black suit.
The man in black's mission was to find and protect Mei.
At this moment, she was scouted to join humanity's fight against the Honkai as a scientist.
The man claimed to be with the 'Fire Moth', an anti-Honkai organisation under the United Nations.
<!-- Page 12 --> Just half a year earlier, Mei had published a paper on quantum mechanics.
This caught the organization's attention, and they had judged her to be the kind of genius that only appears once in a century.
Kevin, unwilling to leave Mei, requested to join the Fire Moth as well, as a soldier.
This way, the boy and the girl's fate were quietly tied together.
Three years later...
<!-- Page 13 --> Humanity had defeated the Sixth Herrscher.
After experiencing brutal battles, Kevin had become an experienced warrior.
<!-- Page 14 --> In the battle with the Honkai, humanity lost over half its forces. Facing the humans in distress, the Honkai heightened its offensive.
The Seventh Herrscher, the "Herrscher of Flame", held a destructive power far exceeding that of Herrschers prior.
Within just a week of her birth, she had turned the entirety of Australia into a sea of fire.
<!-- Page 15 --> In order to combat the Seventh Herrscher, Mei proposed the "Fusion Warrior" plan.
That is to say, to integrate the DNA of an emperor-class Honkai Beast in the human body to create a super warrior with a natural resistance to Honkai Energy, and physical strength that surpasses that of a human.
<!-- Page 16 --> To support Mei's plan, Kevin offered himself as a test subject.
The DNA of the emperor-level Honkai beast "Parvanti", which could control ice and snow, was integrated into his body.
After experiencing unspeakable pain, Kevin obtained the power to control ice and snow, but his body was also damaged irreparably.
<!-- Page 17 -->  Under the leadership of Kevin, now wielding the power of Honkai, humanity finally defeated the Herrscher of Flame.
However, Kevin felt no joy from his victory.
<!-- Page 18 --> He had the DNA of a Honkai Beast, and his body temperature was always minus 30 degrees Celsius. If anyone stood next to him, they would get frostbite.
He could no longer embrace the one he loved most. He would have to endure this loneliness for the rest of his life.
Five more years passed like this...
<!-- Page 19 --> Kevin became one of the world's strongest warriors.
His unique physique made him the only one who could control Divine Key: "Judgement of Shamash".
<!-- Page 20 --> With the power of Judgement of Shamash, he defeated the Ninth and Eleventh Herrscher on his own.
Even so, in the face of the Final Herrscher's might, he was powerless to save humanity from extinction.
With his companions dead, Kevin had no choice but to retreat.
<!-- Page 21 --> Fortunately, Mei's "Project Stigma" was finally complete.
The human civilisation of this Era had come to an end, but there was a spark of hope left for the next Era.
However, years of hard work and the erosion of Honkai energy had slowly taken Mei's life from her.
<!-- Page 22 --> When Kevin arrived back at base...
What he found was Mei, collapsed before the command desk, having left peacefully after completing her work.
<!-- Page 23 --> Kevin wanted to follow suit, after the one he loved most, when he suddenly heard a baby crying.
Following the sound of the crying, Kevin found a baby and a letter in the lab.
In the letter left by Mei, she told Kevin that this was a test-tube baby born from the combination of Kevin and Mei's DNA. Mei also improved the baby's genes, and when he grew up, his body temperature would be the same as that of a normal person.
<!-- Page 24 --> In order to fulfill Mei's last wish, Kevin brought the baby to the shelter and entered the cold sleeping cabin.
Time passed by. After about 50,000 years, the old human civilization had turned into yellow sand, and on this land, a new human being was born.
And as civilisation developed, it was once again threatened by the Honkai.
<!-- Page 25 --> And then appeared before humanity...
a white-haired warrior, a giant flaming sword in his left hand, and a baby in his right.
This man who called himself 'Kaslana' would bring new hope to this Era.
<!-- Page 26 --> This, 50.000 years in the past, is the story of Kevin Kaslana.
