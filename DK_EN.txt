<!-- Page 1 --> On this planet, the Honkai grows with civilisation.
The more human civilisation develops, the stronger the Honkai's restraints on it become.
<!-- Page 2 --> Over 52.000 years ago, a previous generation of humans on Earth had developed a high level civilisation.
In order to inhibit the continued development of this civilisation, beings with a human form, yet supernatural in kind, were born from the Honkai: "The Herrscher"
The Sixth Herrscher accelerated the apoptosis of living cells:<br> "The Herrscher of Death"
The Seventh Herrscher controlled the motions of molecules:<br> "The Herrscher of Flame"
The Fourth Herrscher could create ideal fluids:<br> "The Herrscher of Wind"
The Third Herrscher could control the electromagnetic field:<br> "The Herrscher of Thunder'
<!-- Page 3 --> The Herrschers' abilities are extremely powerful.
But with the support of a power called "technology", humans have defeated Herrschers time and again.
<!-- Page 4 --> In order to battle the Herrschers, which were becoming more and more evolved, humanity began to study their secrets.
By sealing the remnants of the "Fragmented Herrscher Cores" in Soulium made from nano machines, humans created "weapons".
But humanity was not satisfied with this. Under the leadership of MEI, the top scientist of that civilisation, mankind strode deeper into the field.
To seek the origin of the Honkai was taboo research, and the material used for that research was the Herrscher Cores.
